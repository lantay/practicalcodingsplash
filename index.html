				<h1>How we do it</h1>
				<p>The quality of a multi-thousand dollar bootcamp at the cost of a $99 online course</p>
				<p style="text-transform:none !important">
					It’s the way programmers THINK that matters. It’s about how they set up their coding environment, the way they search for
					information when they don’t know the answer, and what type of projects they choose to create. It’s too common that people
					get discouraged by all of the boring functions when starting to program without actually having the opportunity to build
					any cool products. Bootcamps used to be the only way to get that information… until now. </p>
